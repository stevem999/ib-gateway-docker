docker compose up &
vnc://127.0.0.1:5900 from Finder on Mac (with CMD+K) + "myVncPassword" as myVncPassword
from bot repo, Arthur-RSI-testing branch (not this repo!), run "test_minimal_connection.py" and-or "bot/RSART-official-bot/add_data.py"
(the "test_connection.py" here does not work - wrong API)

they should both work and you should see 4 lines in VNC after running the script, also adding tabs for each clients IDs
(should use one clientID per client code developed)
