docker compose up &
vnc://127.0.0.1:5900 from Finder on Mac (with CMD+K) + "myVncPassword" as myVncPassword
from bot repo, Arthur-RSI-testing branch (not this repo!), run "test_minimal_connection.py" and-or "bot/RSART-official-bot/add_data.py"
(the "test_connection.py" here does not work - wrong API)

they should both work and you should see 4 lines in VNC after running the script, also adding tabs for each clients IDs
(should use one clientID per client code developed)

For ECR + ECS: 
2. Create ECR repository first:
  # Create ECR repo
  # aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ib-gateway --region your-region

  # Login and push
  aws ecr get-login-password --region "us-east-1" | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 1234567890.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

  docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t 1234567890.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ib-gateway2:stable ./stable --push
